#Project, "Dice Game with Computer," sounds like a fun and engaging challenge! 

1. **Computer Number Generation**: 
   - Generate random numbers from the computer and store them in a variable.

2. **Round of Computer Generated Numbers**:
   - Round off each computer-generated number and store them in separate variables.

3. **Multiple Rounds**:
   - Repeat the process of generating computer numbers and rounding them five times, storing each round's result in different variables.

4. **Calculate Total**:
   - Calculate the sum of the computer-generated numbers and store it in another variable.

5. **Outcome Determination**:
   - Implement a condition to check if the total of the computer-generated numbers is greater than or equal to 15.
   - If the total is >=15, display "You Win from Computer" using `console.log`, otherwise display "You Lose from Computer".

With these features, players can engage in multiple rounds of the game, with the outcome determined by the total sum of the computer-generated numbers. This structure provides clear steps and logic for both generating and evaluating the computer's moves, enhancing the gameplay experience.
